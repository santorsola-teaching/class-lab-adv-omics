[2024-11-04 11:18:00.503] [jointLog] [info] NOTE: We recommend using tximport (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) for aggregating transcript-level salmon abundance estimates to the gene level.  It is more versatile, exposes more features, and allows considering multi-sample information during aggregation.
